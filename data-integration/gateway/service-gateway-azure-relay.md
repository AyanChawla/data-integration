# Set the Azure Relay for on-premises data gateway

During installation of the on-premises data gateway, the Azure Relays are automatically provisioned. However, you have the option to provide your own relay details.

**To provide your own relay details**

1.	Select **Provide Relay details**.

2.	You can now provide additional details about your relay.

    2. **Send key value and the Listen Key Value**&mdash;Create two shared access policies, one called SendAccessKey and the other ListenAccessKey. Provide either the primary or the secondary keys in the on-premises data gateway app. To learn more, see [Azure Relay authentication and authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-relay/relay-authentication-and-authorization).

>[!Note]
>If you recover an existing gateway with customized relay details to a new machine, you'll have to explicitly uninstall the gateway from the old machine or rotate the sender and listener keys. If this operation isnâ€™t done, then queries through this gateway may fail.
